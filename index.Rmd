# Introduction

In this book, I will summarize everything that I know about time series analysis.

## Ferien &amp; "Special Events" Charakteristiken

Many time series are characterized by holidays, as well as *other special events*. The following characteristics can be observed, when you are faced with those types of regressors:

- They provide large, somewhat predictable shocks.
- <u>Oftentimes</u>, they do *not* follow a periodic pattern. For instance, Thanksgiving in the United States occurs on the fourth Thursday in November.
- Because of this irregular pattern of occurence (non-periodic), it is diï¬ƒcult to implement a function that is able to declare these events.
- Typically, the impact of a particular holiday on the time series is often similar, year after year.
